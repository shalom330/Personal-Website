            Hey there! As you already know from my home page,my name is Shalom Muturi.
            
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-2"> I got the passion for programming when I was in secondary school where we wrote pseudocodes and drew flowcharts and I was fascinated by the idea of how application sofware are formed and how they work under the hood.
            I was introduced to this short course by a friend and so far. I am learning a lot of new exciting skills which may help me in the years to come during my university and career path.
